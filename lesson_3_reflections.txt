QUESTION: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What
would be easier, and what would be harder?

ANSWER: I would use a file sharing service like Google Drive or Drop Box.
Usin Git and GitHub would be easier because of being able to manage 
changes to files and Git provides version control.  Google Drive and Drop
Box may provide some thing similar but there is not staging area and way
to easily collaborate.
