QUESTION: What are some situations when branches would be
helpful in keeping your history organized?  How would 
branches help?

ANSWER: If I wanted to update a portion of my code
while still keeping the main repository unchanged, I 
could create a branch that now has that code.

Another situation is when I want to make a newer version
of the code by keeping some elements but then starting 
over on some other elements, I could use a branch of
the main repository to make those changes.
