How did viewing diff between two versions of a file help you
see the bug that was introduced?

Using diff is a bit difficult at first, due to the extra
markings and not being sure of their meaning.

After looking at it for a bit I was able to pick out the
original code and see where the typo was in comparing
game_old.js and game_new.js.

QUESTION: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

ANSWER: Having the file's history would allow me to view past
versions and the changes since that past version. If I wanted
to go back to a prior version's code base then I could use
the history to go back to a time before a bug had been 
introduced in the code, for example.

This would make me a much more efficient programmer.

QUESTION: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

ANSWER: Pros are controlling commits, able to commit logically,
able to commit after certain milestons.
Cons: Forgetting to commit, commits not done frequently enough,
commits are not performed logically.

QUESTION: Why do you think some version control systems, like
Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

ANSWER: Allowing multiple files to be saved in one commit is
important when files are dependent on each other for their 
code.  These files work together hand in hand to provide
some computer functionality. Git stores computer related files
which are dependent upon one another in order to work. The 
file saving features of Google Docs do not take into account
file dependency, as Google Docs does not store computer
related code files, but rather saves business/educational
type documents.

QUESTION: How can you use the commands git log and git diff 
to view the history of files?

ANSWER: I can use git log to see the history of commits along
with their ID.  Then I pick an ID that I want to compare to 
the previous ID (commit) and type them in like so using git
diff:
EXAMPLE: git diff 'commit ID old' 'commit ID new'

------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION: How might using version control make you more 
confident to make changes that could break something?

ANSWER: Knowing that git can revert to previous versions
makes me more confident that I can return to prior code
that was not broken.

------------------------------------------------------------
QUESTION: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do
you want to try using Git for?

ANSWER: I want to use Git to provide examples of my code to 
potential employers.
